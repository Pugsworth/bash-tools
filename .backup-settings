# list of directories to be copied from -> to (relative to backupdir)
# Caution: trailing slash matters
# trailing slash will sync the contents rather than folder itself
#
# to sync a directory itself with contents to a location, do not use a trailing slash
# otherwise a trailing slash syncs the CONTENTS of src to the destination folder
# Example:
#
# [Directories]
# ~/test/ -> /some/synced/location/
#
# ~/test/
# ├── test.7zip
# ├── test.avi
# ├── test.bak
#
# ~/some/synced/location/
# ├── test.7zip
# ├── test.avi
# ├── test.bak
#
# [Directories]
# ~/test -> /some/synced/location/
#
# ~/test/
# ├── test.7zip
# ├── test.avi
# ├── test.bak
#
# ~/some/synced/location/
